# Object_Detection

Developed a grocery store object detection system using TensorFlow and MobileNetV2, enabling real-time classification of fruits, vegetables, and packaged items. Trained a custom model on a structured dataset and optimized it for deployment using TFLite for efficient on-device inference. Integrated real-time detection via OpenCV for practical application in retail environments.
